			<h3>¡DIGNIDAD!</h3>
			<p>
				The Spanish word dignidad can be translated as both pride and self-esteem. Both meanings drive Repertorio’s education efforts. Since its beginning, Repertorio Español has committed its resources to making theatre accessible and part of the classroom experience with the aim of instilling cultural pride, promoting self-awareness, divulging the riches of Spanish-language theatre.
			</p>

				Through ¡Dignidad! what we hope to accomplish is to create the next generation of theatergoers, or better still, the next generation of theatre artists with a love and respect for live theatre. <br/>

		  <h3>In-School Residency Program</h3>
		  <div class="col-md-6 left-side">
		  	<p>Professional teaching artists lead these residencies. They are working playwrights and actors with previous teaching experience at all levels. In partnership with classroom teachers and school administrators, we create a series of sequential lessons designed to enhance classroom assignments as well as expand the students’ creativity and emotional expression. These lessons follow the New York City Blueprint for teaching the Performing Arts, the New York State Learning Standards and will address the new Common Core Curriculum. 
			<p>Workshops are taught in English and/or Spanish, and often reach students who ordinarily would not have the opportunity to actively participate in theatre. This exposure builds on their literacy skills, critical and analytical thinking as well as their self-awareness, self-expression and overall creativity—skills that can translate into other academic subjects and their personal lives. </p>
			<p>Students will learn acting techniques and the craft of playwriting and are required to create fully developed original monologues, group scenes or an adaptation based on an established text. Long-term residencies have a culminating event at Repertorio, using our sound system, lights, costumes and props in front of an audience of their peers, teachers and parents.</p>
